In this zipfile, there are three types of files
    1. Submission files. These include the tex document that includes the explanation of results as well as the images used in it.
    2. MATLAB script files.  These are MATLAB files that can be run directly provided all of the accompanying functions are present. They are titled 'tsquireQ#'.  They can be run to duplicate the results in the tex file of explanations. 
    3. MATLAB function files.  These are MATLAB files that are called by the script files mentioned before. They are well documented and are also explained in the tex file.
