In this zipfile, there are three types of files
    1. Submission files. These include the tex document that includes the explanation of results as well as the images used in it.
    2. MATLAB script files.  These are MATLAB files that can be run directly provided all of the accompanying functions are present. They are titled '88759Q#' (my prelim id).  They can be run to duplicate the results in the tex file of explanations. 
    3. MATLAB function files.  These are MATLAB files that are called by the script files mentioned before. They are well documented and are also explained in the tex file.  

The file Analysis.pdf is the main file.  It contains brief explanations of the functions used as well as answers to the questions given in the assignment. Unzip the Codes.rar file to obtain 5 script files and 7 function files.  Each script file answers (or computes the answers and corresponding plots) to a different question.  Each function file is called in one of the 5 script files.  The script files specify function dependencies. Last but not least, the Plots.rar file contains the images used in Analysis.pdf.  It should be unnecessary, but in case you wanted to take a closer look, they are there.
